# Gold IRA Sales Analysis MCP Server

An advanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for analyzing B2C Gold IRA sales call transcripts through 6 specialized prompts executed in strategic order. Compatible with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other MCP clients. Hosted on [smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai) for broad accessibility.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This MCP server provides AI assistants with structured prompts and context to perform comprehensive analysis of B2C Gold IRA sales calls. Instead of running the analysis internally, it supplies the AI with everything needed to execute the analysis using their own LLM capabilities.

## ðŸ”„ Analysis Framework

### Execution Order: 2â†’3â†’4â†’5â†’6â†’1

The system executes 6 specialized prompts in a specific strategic order, with each analysis building context for the next:

1. **Prompt.2** - Conversation Dynamics Analysis *(First execution)*
2. **Prompt.3** - Psychology & Decision-Making Profile 
3. **Prompt.4** - Objection Analysis & Handling
4. **Prompt.5** - Deal Risk Assessment  
5. **Prompt.6** - Action Plan & Follow-up Strategy
6. **Prompt.1** - Strategic Qualification Assessment *(FINAL comprehensive)*

> **Critical Note**: Prompt.1 serves as the FINAL comprehensive assessment that synthesizes insights from all 5 previous analyses.
